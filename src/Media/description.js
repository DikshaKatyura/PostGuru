const description = "I am a filmmaker,Vidoe editor, cinematographer, visual effects editor, director in short, an Artist. My journey to filmmaking has been nothing but twists and turns of learning and realizations. Since childhood I was fascinated by the dynamics of a camera. How could a camera following a scene from different angles make me feel adventurous. I wondered how visual effects and techniques can build an entire city and giant monsters in those Sci-Fi movies. Hence I was introduced to cinematography and VFX. My curiosity knew no bounds from then on. I learned how videos are made and manipulated using visual effects. Alas! I became an editor as a teenager, editing gave me the foundation I needed to move towards a much bigger goal in my life, that is - Direction. In 2019 I started my independent Social media page across all platforms - Post Guru as a content creator. Since then I have shot, directed and edited content for industry giants like Volkswagen, KFC, Mahindra, Realme, Monte Carlo, Amazon, One8 to name a few. Throughout my journey and work catalog I have never believed in straightforward storytelling. With each project I take on I innovate and present each story from a different angle. My motto in my work is to use 100% of the given resources and deliver beyond my clients' expectations while maintaining efficiency and consistency, which is why I have been able to build relationships of trust with my clientele.";
